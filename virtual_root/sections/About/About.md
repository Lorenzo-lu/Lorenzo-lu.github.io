Thank you for visiting.

I am a graduate student pursuing a Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, studying the fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) for diagnoisis and live-capture of cancer, the dark-field single-photon imaging and video motion compensation.

Between 2013 and 2017, I studied Geochemistry at Nanjing University, China. My thesis project involved promoting the Atomic Pair Distribution Function method onto lab X-ray diffraction devices. In Dec 2019, I was conferred with a Master's degree at UW-Madison where I changed my major into Materials Science and Engineering. After that semester, I started my new adventure in Electrical and Computer Engineering. My experiences in different majors contributed not only to my knowledge but also to my philosophy, which affects my understanding towards the world and my methodologies to solve the problems.

As a greedy explorer, I am never satisfied with the correct results. In my philosophy, a good design involves both correct results and efficient strategies. In most of my work, I am always trying to find a universal strategy/method/solution to many scenarios including those not there but may appear in the future. I am also a committed engineer insisting that human should always leave repeating work to machines and computers as much as possible. This opinion is also shown in this website, where the modularized and distributed sections are embeded into `yz_containers`.

Despite being aided by a a lot of small homemade tools like short codes, I am not super engineering in leisure time. In this case, the purpose of my coding is "making my life beautiful". One of my favorite stuff is photography. My photos are not featured by exquisite expression, but the capture of the transitory. Therefore, my most common camera is my mobile. When necessary, I code to improve the pictures taken under extreme conditions (e.g. perseid meteor shower, Neowise Comet) or with poor quality (backlight/blurred). This hobby is what my research interest can be tracked back to.
