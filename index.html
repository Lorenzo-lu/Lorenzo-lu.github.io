                 I used to be a geochemist telling universe evolution stories by isotopes, but my stories could not even persuade myself.
                 <br>
                 I used to be a materials engineer measuring the interatomic distances by X-ray, but I found my focus is in the laser instead of the sample.
                 <br>
                 So I left my nesting zones and started travelling again and again. My life is led by a compass, not a clock. Life is short, so every decision matters.

                 I am pursuing a doctorate in Electrical Engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. My research area is computational imaging/photography. Under the guidance of prof. Andreas Velten, I am now developing a computatinal fluorescence lifetime camera for medical applications. 

                 <br></br>

                 I was conferred with an M.S. in Materials Science and a B.S. in Geochemistry. My experiences in different majors contributed not only to my knowledge but also to my philosophy, which affects my understanding towards the world and my methodologies to solve the problems. 

                 <br></br>

                 I have a strong insterest towards the progress and technologies in other areas. In my leisure, I usually learn new skills from online courses or people from different majors. One of my recent interest is defining a coding 
                 format to minimize bugs. For instance, for research programs in Python, I prefer a passing-by-reference approach to avoid the casual variable declarations in Python. The function-oriented-programming is widely used in my research code. I even developed tools modifying PyTorch to fit my programming habits.

                 From my point of view, a good code won't require the coder to pay extra efforts to the work that can be done by computers. Especially, for researchers, the codes should never contain a bunch of variables with abstract names (actually, this can be fixed by building a tree structure), and should be highly modularized so that you won't make a huge adaption when you advisor comes up with some 'novel' ideas.

            Recently, I am working on a sub-project concerning the single-pixel sensor imaging in dark environments. The Poisson noise is a great challenge to our photon counting system. Due to COVID-19, most work in 2020 was conducted by simulation. Algorithms are tested on EigenFaces dataset.

            <li>
            Use the same EigenFaces dataset, I trained a Generative Adversarial Network for human face generation.

            For me, only knowing how to use PyTorch is not enough. In this project, I also developed a tool for build the PyTorch model more efficiently.
